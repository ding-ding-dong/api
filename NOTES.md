### TODO

### DONE
- Crop images to enhance browser performance
  Solution: do not crop because the image can be cached which will benefit when open the detail page
  Use background-image to avoid the browser image scaling which can cause performance cost
  PS: however, it's worthy to checkout the "experimental" branch for the crop solution
